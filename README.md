# Discover Weekly Archive

This is a tool to replace the functionality that was available via the IFTTT applet where every time your Discover Weekly is updated, it adds all then new tracks to a separate playlist to save them as the Discover Weekly playlist overwrites itself every week. For the underlying boilerplate services that enable interaction with Spotify via it's API, I borrowed heavily from https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/Sp0.
